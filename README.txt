This is all the source code for a content-management system I developed 
in 2002 and commercialized into a product called PACDepot. It was 
originally conceived as a platform for classified ads (PAC is short
for Petites Annonces Class√©es which is the French translation of 
"classified ad"). The product quickly grew into a full CMS used by 
around 15 clients at the peak and helped generate some money for a few 
years while I was in university.

The core architecture follows an MVC pattern using Java Servlets and
XSLT templates to manage the view. The database used at the time was 
MySQL and it was deployed on a Tomcat server. I had just read Erik 
Burke's Java and XSLT book for a client project and liked the clean
architecture so I decided to build on that.

I collected all the documentation and diagrams I could find into the 
"Docs" folder. In particular, take a look at the file "pacdepot-ecrans.pdf" 
to get a sense of what this system looked like when it was up and running. 
There are also some documents describing the different features for the
product.

I'm putting this up in case anyone might find something useful here,
and also as a little trip down memory lane for myself. I'm releasing
the code into the public domain as per the license below. In short,
you can do whatever you want with it, just don't sue me!
